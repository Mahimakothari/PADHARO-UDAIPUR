Well Udaipur is a city of lakes. Most common sight-seeing places are:-
//updated content
Fateh sagar: During winter times there are various exhibitions being put up such as tea exhibition or flower gallery cum exhibition.
City palace: If you are into knowing the big royal palaces this will always be on your list.
Sajjangarh:- situated at the top of the mountain. One could really enjoy the scenic beauty of the city.
Shilpgram:- A small village themed area where there a various cultural programs performed in the evenings many warm cloth stalls ( village is alive only on December though)
If you are more of a gully boy and want to taste some serious street food then I highly recommend going to stalls near the Sukhadiya Circle ( those stalls serve really good spicy pani puris.)

There are lot more place to visit such as some temples whose names I don't remember and Gulab bagh (zoo) and Badi lake.

PS:- try not to visit Udaipur in winter season coz its very chilled here.
